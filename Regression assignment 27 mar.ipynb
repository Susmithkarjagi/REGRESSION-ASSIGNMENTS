    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Y) that can be explained by the independent variable(s) (X) in a linear regression model.

It does not account for the complexity of the model, the number of independent variables, or the presence of multicollinearity. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics and statistical tests to assess the overall performance and validity of the regression model."

Lasso tends to favor one predictor over another, even if they are highly correlated. This selection bias may not align with the true importance of predictors, and other feature selection techniques or domain knowledge may be more reliable.\n",

    "It shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but does not force them to exactly zero.\n",
    "Ridge regularization is effective in reducing the impact of multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors) and stabilizing the model by reducing the variability of coefficient estimates.\n",
    "The regularization parameter determines the degree of regularization. Smaller values result in less shrinkage, while larger values increase the amount of shrinkage.\n",

    "Lasso regression adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter to the loss function.\n",
    "It encourages sparsity in the model, driving some coefficients to exactly zero and effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Lasso regularization is useful when there is a desire to identify and focus on the most important predictors while excluding irrelevant or redundant ones.\n",
    "The regularization parameter controls the degree of regularization, with larger values increasing the sparsity of the model.\n",
    "To determine the better performer, one should consider the goals and characteristics of the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regularization is generally more suitable when the focus is on reducing multicollinearity and maintaining all predictors in the model with attenuated coefficients.\n",
    "Lasso regularization is preferable when feature selection is important and there is a desire to obtain a sparse model with fewer predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are trade-offs and limitations associated with each regularization method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regularization does not drive coefficients to exactly zero, so it keeps all predictors in the model. This may be desirable when all predictors are considered relevant or when maintaining the interpretability of the coefficients is important.\n",
    "Lasso regularization performs feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, which can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model. However, it may introduce biases in variable selection and can be sensitive to the choice of regularization parameter, especially when predictors are highly correlated."
